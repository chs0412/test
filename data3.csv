I changed one of my printers back to a .4 and I'll see if it goes away. I got gaps on the envelope holder and some of the monster boxes I've printed so far.*update, I think it was my temp settings. After it retracts and then starts a new line, it was taking a while before filament would exit the nozzle causing a gap, as well as popping off my bowden tube from the coupler from too much pressure. After increasing the temps it’s looking much better. Lowering the layer height also helped.The initiative markers have a greyed out side on the back for showing when the monster takes their turn. I'll probably use Gloomster to track monsters, so I don't plan to use the tokens in this way. I could also just flip the lids over to show the monster has taken a turn.I was thinking maybe the token holders could be a frame that is hollow so you pop the token into the frame and then it could show both sides of the token and also serve as a lid. The handle would also need to go so they could lay flat in both directions. Just brain storming here."", 'I\'ve uploaded two new models, one hollow, and one hollow without the handle.

Also, without the handle, it\'s actually hard to pull the monster boxes out of the game box.

Made it about 1/2 the height. Then I added two cylinders to the opposite corners so if it’s upside down it stands flat.

It’s clever the initiative markers stick in the lids. Can you make the boss lid use the same smaller lid that could then slide into a larger lid.

Your printer have to be good calibrated and the printed surface have to be smooth as possible. I´m working on a solution, so please give me a few Days to update the constuction.The rings I printed (2nd time) are fairly easy to move by hand, but gravity doesn't pull them down. I was hoping it was a horizontal expansion setting or recommended number of walls. There were no printing recommendations in the Thing Details so I went with medium quality, but sturdy. Tried the rings in higher quality/fine, with some improvement but not quite there.The idea was, that some of suction power will pull the rings down. That works fine on my version. So maybe you need a little bit more suction power.I also add a new ring version with less friction. Hope that works better for you.Just a follow-up: I placed all four rings into the slicer, and centered them, making essentially a print-in-place nested model. I scaled the second ring to 101% XY, the third ring to 102% XY, and the largest ring to 103% XY.
