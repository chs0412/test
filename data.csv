R2D2 the LAST and Final version. Scale 1:4,3DIllusionist,1816,[],22,"[['I just printed the front half of the body shell. It turned out very well.... on to the back half and more.\nThe backside of the body looks good and mates well with the front half. The skirt and body doors are next.Skirt and doors printed good. Not sure how the skirt is attached to the body, other than glue.Doors printed well and fit the body perfectly. I have to add the hinge pins. It appears that .04"" rod will work.Gearbox one and two did not print well, but I will use them. If the design could be changed so that each part has a flat surface it might workout better. I do not like assembling these parts with sheet metal screws, I like nuts and bolts.Please do not take my comments wrong, this is a fantastic project and it is obvious that a lot of good work has already gone into it. Several years ago I made an all aluminum, full scale, fully automated R2-D2. So this project reminds me of that.Just printed the front, center vents. I printed it is very shiny silver and with the last 2 layers in blue. Size was perfect so it fits the hole in the body real well. On my full sized R2-D2 this was behind where I mounted two speakers so you could hear all his beeps, bops and whistles.On the top, front of the body there are three blue strips. The top one is a vent, prints well, attaches well and fits well. The second and third one down does not fit at all, too tall. I printed the first ones at 100% on all three axes and these didn\'t fit. I reprinted them with the ""X"" and ""Y"" axes at 100% and the ""Z"" axis at 86% and this seemed to fit better, but not perfect.I just printed the dome using TTYT Shiny Silver, it turned out perfect! On the front center of the dome there should be a round ""eye-like"" lens. I haven\'t found it yet.On the center front of the body there are 6 ""coin slots"" They do not fit the holes in the body. I cut the tab off the back of each slot and glued them in their place.Just finished the left leg group. The circumference of the fitting that attaches the leg to the body needed a little work so it would go into the leg. After that touch up the assemble just snapped together. It looks great.R2-D2 is now standing on all three feet. He looks great!!.Gearbox 1 & 2 and the wheels for each of the three feet are next.I cannot edit this comment to add a picture showing my progress.

Well done! Here my comments:', ""I'll be honest. This is not comfortable to play. I'm thinking of making the neck more rounded and also make it tapered on the top. The edges of the frets may need sanding down. The biggest issue with this instrument is putting the strings inside the body. Its very frustrating, but I printed another travel uke a while back and had a similar issue. I have some new ideas to fix this. One idea is to put the tuning pegs behind the body not inside. This will allow someone to physically adjust the strings without having to stick their fingers inside the instrument body.I might add a slot for a piezo and a jack to make this an electric acoustic instrument, but I also want to experiment with making solid body electric instruments. I'll see what I can do.Regarding the tuning pegs, there are a couple of solutions:1) I made this one ( https://www.thingiverse.com/make:883546 ) using banjo straight tuning pegs. They are great, and give a de-multiplication effect, which allows for more stable and finer tuning. Unfortunately they are more expensive than regular ones, and this is a deal breaker for me: the reason why I am interested in this kind of design is that they can be really cheap so you can abuse them a bit, otherwise I'd just buy a risa solid which seems a great instrument, but I would be worried to break it all the time if I were packing it in my regular luggage.2) This seems a semsible arrangement ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1845550 ), that can be done with regular geared pegsThe edges of the frets may need sanding down.\nThis is what I have done on mine, but I am thinking of using fret wire instead: it is still pretty inexpensive, and the plastic frets have some texture that produces hearable noise when trying to do a pitch bending.I would also like to know if you have experienced warping of the plastic. My latest make ( https://www.thingiverse.com/make:878970 ) has bended badly, and now I am taking a reflection pause to consider how fix it, if possible.Thanks for letting me know about banjo straight tuning pegs.On mine, I don't really experience warping, but the action is sometimes too high.

Perhaps it would be better to have minimal housing around a toroidal cooling fan to minimise turbulence effects between the blade extremities and the duct? https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/02/03/can-an-award-winning-mit-toroidal-drone-propeller-make-a-better-pc-fan/""], [""I'm having an issue trying to print with either PLA and PETG.

Did a fast annealing of PLA but it's quite hard, I'll try again whilst keeping the support during annealing for a hot air (not required but helps for strength). Then I did a bit of sanding and I'm considering possibly a layer of PU.Printed also in PETG with traditional support, 0.15mm layer height, 0% infill, brim (or raft) for adhesion.Overall compared to my props, these are a lot thinner. This makes PETG also less ideal as it'll likely deform a lot more under stress than my standard props, and PLA will likely not hold the axe for long (I do recommend to warm it to ~60°C and insert them hot before PLA retracts for a better fit).I get that why the tri-loop should be thin so as to keep about the same weight, but I'd still consider a very a bit thicker in the middle area similar to real props.Still printing... will test later.""]]",0,0,4,"by strikingfpv February 09, 2023",https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5844445,5844445,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/70/bc/93/f2/d7/card_preview_cde9a9b3-e6f7-42ae-b733-419dacb44266.png

Home Assistant Sensor Box V1,Waggster,70,['Homeassistant'],5,"[['This is great! Anyway you could upload the raw 3d format? I would like to modify it for an esp32 nodemcu!'], [""The idea is definitely nice, but it's been done to death and there are several problems that have risen from trial and error. Battery life is quite poor unless you have the system running in deep sleep, which you probably haven't considering it updates every 10 seconds, so it's probably a wired sensor box.Also, you are using an ESP board with a generic PIR sensor and that will cause a lot of false positives. ESP boards are very dirty when it comes to RF signals and those cheap PIR sensors are easily triggered.When you calculate the amount of money you'd have to put up quite a bit of money to buy a decent quality PIR sensor (like Panasic's EKMC series) which will cost about 10,- USD/EUR on average per sensor. You add the DHT11, a D1 mini, maybe a Lux sensor as well and consider the filament and electricity usage you'll find yourself around 20 - 25 USD/EUR per DIY sensor unit. Then you'd have to consider the electricity you'd end up using for a wired sensor to be on 24/7.All in all it'd be much easier, cheaper and arguably better to buy a sensor. Like the Aqara P1 which is a wireless sensor that lasts for years on a cheap battery."", ""Seriously... so, everything you have mentioned may be your specification, but it certainly isn't mine.My spec was I wanted to build a sensor box that cost under £10.00, this puts your Aqara sensor out straight away. Yes, it's a decent sensor, but it costs over double, requires a battery and has a slow update time and doesn't offer the functionality I want. I also have tried a couple of the cheaper Aqara ones and the detection distance hasn't been great due to them facing a big window I'm guessing, the lux sensor I have in the Aqara one hardly ever updates for some reason and is quite poor to be honest.So, yes I've gone with a powered version.. that takes power from a USB port or plug. This saves me having to monitor the battery and it makes updates every second possible if needed, no waiting for a 1 min update. I have had great results from the PIR, zero false positives as I've checked my history, but if I did I could always code them out. It's been a lot more reliable than the Aqara or the Sonoff ones I've tried. Yes, the DHT11 isn't the best but it works great for my needs. I only want an idea of the rooms temp, it doesn't control any thermostats or anything.As for the cost of powering the unit, well it really is nothing. 1000w.. or 1kw is 0.40p here in the UK. Even if this thing takes 2 watts an hour (0.40 A) which I very much doubt works out at £7 a year.. the savings however of running these far outways the cost of leaving a load of lights on. So it's a no-brainer.So.. it may have been done to death, but when I searched I couldn't really find anything that suited my needs. Also, I love playing, designing stuff, and creating my own and this was a great little project. I'm now going to be adding my lux sensor that came this weekend and I will then have a complete sensor that does a lot more than the P1 can do for more than half the price.I understand this project isn't for everyone, it might not fit everyone's needs / budgets or ability to create something. However, it might suit someone or just help them by providing ideas etc.. to make something better. I do appreciate your comment and I'm pleased this generated enough interest from you to write the above :-) In the end I'm happy with my little box, but I realise it's not for everyone.Take care,SteveWell, I like the idea, but hat also issues with ESP+PIR and false positives, but a TEMP sensors works fine. Therefore: could you please include the INO file? - I´d like to add this sensor to Home Assistant, but have no clue, yet ;-) thx!"", 'Well, I like the idea, but hat also issues with ESP+PIR and false positives, but a TEMP sensors works fine.
