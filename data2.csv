So yeah, go post a make about them and I\'ll try to help you further there.Thanks again!ok make is incoming in 5.Okay, I uploaded a ne stl file under this page for one I designed specifically for the DJI Avata from your pictures. I looked up the diameter of the stock DJI Avata props to double check mine will fit without being scaled down. Hopefully that will fix the printing issues as well. Let me know how they go!thank you! the hub appears to be smaller. that may result in more volume for ""the prop"" and more thrust. lets hope so. I am printing a sample in 0.06mm layer hight now for a test fit. you would not need to research the size of the avata duct, I could tell you easily ^^\nit is measured at 74.5mm.

I'd like to learn more about how you painted it. I've painted a few basic things, but nothing as complex as your work here.Paints? Brushes? Guides or shields to keep paint off wrong surface?"", ""Thanks for reaching out! I'm glad you like the plant.\nActually, with valentine's day around the corner, I was already quite late with painting and uploading the model so I cut some corners and started with a bigger brush (size 2) than I usually do. I switched to a smaller brush (size 0) for repairing mistakes and working on a few details later.If I remember correctly, this is roughly what I did:1.) Applying a rather thick primer in order to smooth out the most visible print lines. (cheap spray can from the hardware store)\n2.) I painted a base coat of brown, green (light/dark), orange and magenta acrylic paints and tried to make that green gradient work. ;-) (vallejo model color)\n3.) Repairing the most visible mistakes with a smaller brush.\n4.) Applying some washes (red/green/sepia) for 'quick' shadows.\n5.) Dry-brushing everything with bit of white acrylic paint to make the highlights more visible.\n6.) I then slightly brushed over the highlights with watered down colors (red/green/yellow) in order to dye the white highlights.\n7.) In a last step I applied some speedpaints (red/green/yellow) here and there in order to enhance some of the shadows and saturation. (army painter speedpaint) (Inks would probably have worked just as well - but I don't have those. ;-) )Hope this helps.WOW. Yes! Thanks for your detailed explanation. It's probably the best description of painting 3D objects I've seen on the Thingiverse.Thanks, I'm glad it is useful. :-)\nThinking about it, there is one thing I'd like to add: Most of this is roughly following a common standard workflow for miniature painting. If I had a little more time, I'd probably had skipped the dry brushing on this model and had painted the highlight my hand, instead. Here is why:\nAs this is a FDM print (PLA) the layer lines are rather prominent. Dry brushing enhances small details, so with FDM prints there is always the danger of making these more visible (instead of the actual details in the model). However since I was in a hurry and this technique is extremely fast, I still resorted to it. Luckily the primer filled most of the layer lines so this still worked good enough. :-)"", ""WOW. Yes!

I hadn't heard of these before. I would think that the rotation speed of a drone propeller might stress or deform the ring shape due to the huge centrifugal forces involved.I might try remixing this to see how it works on my over-engineered pullcopter. For that project I also had to first complete another project to create a prop blade model, which transitions between three NACA airfoils from root to tip. For a toroidal propeller pullcopter, I wonder if any increase in efficiency would overcome what appears to be an increase in weight and possibly drag."", 'Since that guy from MIT won his award with a toroidal propeller design loop propellers are becoming increasingly popular. Especially in the copter community. However there are no specific design rules out there as the aerodynamics has not been studied extensively. So everyone interested copies what he finds in the net and tries or adds some modifications – starting from skewed plain rings without any aerodynamic profiles. But - from the point of material strength and smoothness - even with proper airfoil data it seems a bit hopeless trying to use FDA prints to compete against industrial blade designs. However, the community will produce a wide variety of experimental results and that will surely advance the story.']]",0,0,4,"by Parkinbot February 08, 2023",https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5841556,5841556,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/8b/89/9d/6c/fb/card_preview_e079c8be-52dc-4244-bb28-ec0af3ceee06.png

At first I didn\'t know what cards you were talking about with the name ""secret objectives"".Also, I had to enlarge your trays a little bit to work for the Sleeves that came from the KS, as they are very thick.', 'I have updated the image with your suggestion. I really appreciate the feedback.This was designed for the Kickstarter sleeves, but maybe differences in printers or in sleeve thickness from batch to batch. There are more craftable items then purchasable and random, so that side is quite tight. I originally split them evenly but decided later to fit all craftable items on one side. I will probably just create new dividers that have available items first and unavailable afterwards, but you could also make the holder longer and add a spacer on the purchasable side.Np, thx. I did elongate it slightly then I used calipers to measure my decks. I found my challenge deck needed 30mm but I could only make it 29. It fits but a little tight. In prudaslicer I added a negitive modifier block that’s 29mm then put it in the area so it cuts a bit of the divider and back wall. This is a cool way to enlarge a space but it’s tricky to get the block exactly where you need it.Another thing I did was make a cut of the top of the model. Then I print just about 4mm of the top to make a test piece I can try and slide the decks in each section. This saves me a ton of filament and time because it will catch any issues before printing the whole model.I also made it taller so the stock dividers don’t have anything resting on top of them.', 'Np, thx.

I got very excited because this was the longest successful print job that my SV06 has completed...but as soon as I went to assemble the pieces together...the tolerances were too tight and the screw threads wouldn't work properly. I put the adapter over the two-piece collar, but it was so tight that it only made it halfway before being unable to fit any further...and then when I went to separate the pieces...the adapter broke across a layer line rather than slip back off the collar.I printed using Polymaker Tough PETG...is that this issue? Should I just use regular PLA? Please help me out. I'm really bummed that a 16 hour print is useless due to some error on my part."", ""I'm sorry to hear that, Preston. Don't be bummed. Solving the issues is part of the fun. If you saw my video, you can see that there is plenty of clearance, so, my guess is that somewhere in your software or hardware, or both, the calibration is off. PLA is forgiving of course, and that's a good material to start with when calibrating. Create a basic cylinder with a 50mm diameter and 10 or 20mm high and print it at 0.2mm layer height. Then pull out your caliper and see where your dimensions fall. If they're off, then you know you have to calibrate. Once all looks good, try printing only the section of the spool that gave you trouble and go from there. Troubleshooting small sections will save you lots of time and waste less filament. I hope you find my info helpful. which slicer are you using btw?Sounds good. I'll run some calibration tests and see if I need to set my mm/s steps for my X, Y, Z, and Extruder a bit different. That was my thought in the end was that I was probably over-extruding with the PETG. My Extrusion Multiplier for PLA is 1.03, but that might be different with a material with different properties. As far as slicer goes, I have been using mostly Prusaslicer 2.5.0, but I just downloaded Cura 5.2.2 and that's what I used for the print of your Thing. I'll get back to you and let you know if any adjustments were necessary and, if I end up attempting the spool holder in PETG again, I'll let you know if it comes out alright. Thanks for taking the time to reply to my request for help!!! - PrestonI'm using SuperSlicer ( basically the same as PrusaSlicer ). I'm using the M221 S command in my start gcode instead of the Extrusion Multiplier, but if I was to use the M221 value in the Extrusion Multiplier, it would be around 0.9 which is very different than yours. Have you tried a single-wall calibration with your current settings?Yeah, I'm working on a 40mm single-walled open cube for calibrating the Extrusion Multiplier/Flow Rate right now. I did use a calibration cube after my last reply to you and found out I would out of calibration for my steps/mm for X and Z axis and Extruder. Got them dialed back in. I'll see if I can get my dimensional accuracy back before going to sleep tonight."", ""Sounds good.

To our surprise the new sensors detected an alien ship orbiting our eighth planet Neptune.\nWe proceeded to Neptune immediately under alert status to challenge the hidden starship, but we soon discovered why it had not been noticed before.The strange vessel was completely derelict, with only the smallest of residual energies detected and covered in stellar dust. According to Mr Spock's analysis the vessel is some 3000 years old. It has quietly orbited Neptune for almost that entire time just waiting to be discovered.\nMr Scott has analyzed our penetrating scans and believes that most of the technology is significantly less advanced than our own, though he does point out several anomalies such as a strange drive system that does not appear to be a conventional warp-drive.We are about to send an away team to investigate the those anomalies and try to determine the ship's origin.Mr Spock is also interested in a collection he detected of several hundred slab-like formations made of a carbon-based material deep within the ship.Visit my DA for more:\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/dog42a/art/An-Unexpected-Find-925104799""]]",0,0,6,"by Evildave February 11, 2023",https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5847921,5847921,https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/34/c3/d2/ff/e4/card_preview_9b7e62d3-0a33-4514-a204-8cb2367327e7.jpg
