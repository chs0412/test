I see that feature now. Thanks! What prop would you recommend I print? I tried this prop, but it seems to be quite a bit more flimsy than some others that I tried. I also printed in PLA and PTEG and the PLA seems more solid than PTEG.

Here is a link that shows what these toroidal props can do and how he was able to achive getting the max surface area for lift.'], ['Update. I printed this prop at a Z thickness of 10mm, which was as far as I could go and still be able to mount the prop. This resulted in an increase of watt output over the original, but not enough to get near the output of a conventional 3 bladed quad prop. It was a nice experiment and it looks great. I’ll probably hang them on my wall in the hobby room. Thanks Willow for taking the time to design them. I will probably give the 3 and 4 bladed a try.', 'Thanks for the feedback! And yeah, these ones were mostly for fun rather than practical use but interesting to see your results! Did they really fly at all? Im currently working on my V7 series of which the 3"" versions are already out. 5"" is next followed by 40mm and 65mm versions.Thanks again!Well, the stock ones did lift the drone a couple of inches off the ground. The one that i printed at twice the height (9mm) tested with twice the watt output, so if I would have printed another three props it probably would have been able to fly around. I’ll be on the lookout for the v7 5” prop. Thanks', 'Well, the stock ones did lift the drone a couple of inches off the ground.

I’ll be on the lookout for the v7 5” prop. Thanks'], ['Decided to give these a try. Just out of curiosity I mounted them on a drone that is usually very fast on 3s with 3 bladed commercially available 5” quad props. The result was almost no lift. The quad barely got off the ground at full throttle. It had a nice whirring sound, but no lift. I have a 2212.-1400kv motor setup that I test 3d printed props on and I mounted one of these to it. The Toroidal prop pulls 92watts at 7amps. By comparison, the two bladed toroidal prop, which is 6 inches in diameter, pulls 187w at 16 amps on the same setup. The 6 bladed seems to not be grabbing enough air. I’m not giving up on it yet. I’m printing one with taller blades by upping the “Z” scale factor at the Slicer. We’ll see what that does. I like the design and it might work at a smaller diameter, on a smaller, lighter drone, as WillowEhrich says.', ""Thank you so much for printing these, I'd love to see some pictures. I figured these wouldn't work very well. They're pretty absurd but fun for the heck of it. If you're looking for ones that might work better as functional props my V6 props and my upcoming V7 props are likely to work better.
